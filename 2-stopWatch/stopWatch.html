<h1>Making a Stop Watch</h1>

<div class="row">
  <p>
    Here, we'll make a simple stopwatch that will have three buttons - start, stop and reset.
    There should already be a pre-made stop watch constructor available in the js file - which we will go over,
    as it is does touch on some relatively complex concepts that might need explaining (like what a constructor is)
    but the goal here is to figure out where angular comes in more than anything else. One of Angular's strengths
    is binding data from javascript to the view, and here we'll go over the very common use case of binding click events
    to buttons.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a quick refresher, we currently have this on the body tag:
  </p>

  <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
    ng-app="stopWatch" ng-controller="stopWatchController as swCtrl"
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <p>
    And these scripts are being referenced:
  </p>

  <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
    <p>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../../assets/vendor/angular/angular.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="stopWatchComplete.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <p>
    That means that we have an angular module called 'stopWatch' defined in a script that is available to this page,
    and a controller called 'stopWatchController' that is available in that module. When we want to access data from
    that controller, we would normally have to type out stopWatchController.someData every time, and that can get
    tedious, so we are using the 'controller as' format, and creating a shorthand we are calling swCtrl, so instead
    we just need to type swCtrl.someData. You'll also notice that I am referencing the angular.js file here - in any
    new angular app, this needs to be available.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <p>
    Now lets get to actually making our little stop watch. You can do this any way you like, and the complete version
    of this file will include an already made version with some basic styles that you can take a look at after if you
    are having some trouble or if you want something (reasonably) good looking to work with. But for now, just make
    something in html that has a container, a place to show the elapsed time, and three buttons. Once we have that, lets
    wire up some functions. First, lets take a look at the controller file, specifically at these important pieces:
  </p>

  <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
    <p>vm.stopWatch = new StopWatch();</p>

    <p>self.start = function...</p>

    <p>self.stop = function...</p>

    <p>self.reset = function...</p>

    <p>self.getElapsedMs = function...</p>
  </div>
  <p>These are the important properties that we will be interacting with in our view here. What we want to do is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Bind the start/stop/reset functions to their appropriate buttons</li>
    <li>2. Show the elapsed time somewhere</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For the first step, let's take a look at an important angular specific attribute (in case you don't remember,
    when referring to attributes in html, we're talking about those little bits of text we put between on a tags header,
    for example something like class="myClass" - class is the attribute).
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4>ngClick/ng-click</h4>

  <p>
    ngClick is an important attribute used in basically every angular application. It's technically a directive,
    which is something I will probably go over quickly at some point in this lesson, but I won't touch on too much
    as it can be a bit advanced. Anyway, ngClick, when given a function, fires that function when the element housing it
    is clicked on. Simple enough, but there a few important things to remember. Firstly, html is not case sensitive - so
    having capital letters isn't going to be useful, so all directives that are automatically converted to dash spaced
    from camelCase - ie, ngClick turns into ng-click when used on an element.
  </p>

  <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
    &lt;button ng-click="yourCtrl.itsFunction()" &gt; &lt;/button&gt;
  </div>

  <p>
    This would be an example of how you would put a function on a button! Knowing this, and the previous lesson
    on how to bind regular properties to the view, try and make a stop watch using the four functions listed above!
