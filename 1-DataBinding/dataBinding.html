<h1>Data Binding</h1>

<p>When you want to wire up your code to your view, you have a few things you need to make sure to do.</p>

<ul>
  <li class="row">
    <h4>Reference Angular Module</h4>
    <p>The first step is to make a javascript file where you'll initiate your application, it should look something like this.</p>
    <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
      angular.module('dataBinding', []);
    </div>
    <p>
      This is pretty simple, and to keep it from getting complicated, I'll just point out that when making a new module
      you need to make sure to have two arguments, the first argument is a string which will be the module's name (in this
      case this is the actual module I am using for this demo, and it's name) and the second parameter is an array of modules
      you want to have available in this module. Not something we will be covering right now, so we'll be keeping it an empty array.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the HTML document, you need to now do two things - reference this js file and specify the angular app on a top level
      element of the document. Something like this
    </p>

    <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
      &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="dataBinding.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
    </div>
    <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
      &lt;body ng-app="dataBinding"&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    </div>
    <p>
      The reason why this is done on the body element is because everything within the element is under the scope
      of the application. If we put this on a div for example, I could only interact with this module inside of that div
    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Reference Angular Controller</h4>
    <p>
      Once you have the app setup, you need to use what's called a controller to actually interact with the view.
    </p>
    <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
      var app = angular.module('dataBinding', []);
      <br/>
      app.controller('dataBindingController', function () {
      <br/>
      });
    </div>

    <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">
      &lt;body ng-app="dataBinding" ng-controller="dataBindingController as dbCtrl"&gt;
    </div>

    <p>
      This extends what we had in the previous step. Instead of just having a module, we are setting
      the module to a variable, and calling the controller method. This method takes two arguments, the first
      being the name of the controller as a string, the second a function that represents the controller scope.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Use Curly Brackets</h4>
    <p>
      Finally we want to get some code from the controller in the javascript file to show up in the view.
      The simplest example will be just binding a string to the view.
    </p>

    <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text">

      <p>var app = angular.module('dataBinding', []);</p>

      <p>
        app.controller('dataBindingController', function () {
        <br/>
          var vm = this;
        <br/>
        vm.textExample = 'Hello World/Class!'.
        <br/>
        });
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      First, you need to reference 'this'. Here, to make it more understandable (and as to not confuse it with other
      'this' scopes), we're setting it to a variable called vm, which is shorthand for view model. Basically this
      is going to be what is referenced in the view itself. You'll have a better idea what I mean in the next code snippet.
      I am creating a property on the vm where I put a simple string, and now I want this string to show up on the webpage itself.
    </p>

    <div class="card-panel hoverable blue-grey darken-2 white-text" ng-non-bindable>
      &lt;div&gt;
      <br/>
      {{dbCtrl.textExample}}
      <br/>
      &lt;/div&gt;
    </div>
    <p>And that's it! Try it for yourself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
